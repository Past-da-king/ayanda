// This file can be used to re-export commonly used icons
// For this project, we'll import directly from lucide-react in components
// to keep it simpler for this specific output.
// If you had many icons, creating a dedicated file like this would be good practice.

// Example (not used directly in this solution, but shows the pattern):
/*
export {
  UserCircle2,
  Lock,
  Send,
  MoreHorizontal,
  Edit,
  Trash2,
  X,
  CheckSquare,
  Square,
  ChevronDown,
  CalendarDays,
  ListChecks,
  Target,
  StickyNote,
  PlusCircle,
  GripVertical,
  Bell,
  Search
} from 'lucide-react';
*/

// We will import lucide-react icons directly in the components that use them.
// e.g. import { UserCircle2 } from 'lucide-react';
export {};
